This is a prototype music app designed for rapid deployment to Vercel or local development.  
Style: purple → blue gradient, glassmorphism, modern UI.

## How to run locally

```
3. Run dev server:

```

## Deploy to Vercel / V0
- Push to GitHub and import project into Vercel (or use V0).
- Vercel will detect Next.js and run build automatically.
